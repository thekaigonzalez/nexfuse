NexFUSE

    the alternative to OpenLUD OBI(OpenLUD ByteCode Intermediate) written
    entirely in ANSI C

    FUSE supports the concept of incremental memory allocation, meaning that
    instead of every byte being allocated on the heap, only a few of them are
    allocated at a time. for example: if you have a list of 10 bytes, and the
    incremental pointer is 10, then there will only be 1 malloc call, instead of
    calling it 10 times.

    nexfuse supports all of the OpenLUD standard features as well as contains
    new features that are not supported by OpenLUD.

    nexfuse features include:

    OpenLUD OBI:
        * NNULL as statement terminators

        * CLEAR
        * PUT
        * GET
        * INIT
        * END
    
    FUSE features:
        * SUB - starts a subroutine
        * ENDSUB - ends a subroutine
