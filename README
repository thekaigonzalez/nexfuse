NexFUSE

    the alternative to OpenLUD OBI(OpenLUD ByteCode Intermediate) written
    entirely in ANSI C

    FUSE compiles on Windows, Linux, MacOS, as well as on embedded systems that
    may not have as much memory.

    FUSE supports the concept of incremental memory allocation, meaning that
    instead of every byte being allocated on the heap, only a few of them are
    allocated at a time. for example: if you have a list of 10 bytes, and the
    incremental pointer is 10, then there will only be 1 malloc call, instead of
    calling it 10 times.

    FUSE is written entirely in ANSI C, with memory-first programming principles
    leading to a consistent allocation order within the entire program, but
    ensuring that the memory is not getting in the way of the bytecode
    interpreter itself.

    this software was written in a day and a half. I had to rush due to going to
    an all-day event so i couldn't put as much time as i wanted to into this
    project. it was meant to be done in 2 days on the spot.

    nexfuse supports all of the OpenLUD standard features as well as contains
    new features that are not supported by OpenLUD.

    nexfuse features include:

    OpenLUD OBI:
        * NNULL as statement terminators
        * ECHO
        * MOVE
        * EACH
        * RESET
        * CLEAR
        * PUT
        * GET
        * INIT
        * END
    
    FUSE features:
        * SUB - starts a subroutine
        * ENDSUB - ends a subroutine
        * GOSUB - jumps to a subroutine
